### About this Specialization
<p>Discover the tools software developers use to build scalable AI-powered algorithms in TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework.<br/>
In this four-course Specialization, you’ll explore exciting opportunities for AI applications. Begin by developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improve a network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. You’ll teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry! - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice">Source</a></p>
